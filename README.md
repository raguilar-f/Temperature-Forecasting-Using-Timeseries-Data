# Temperature-Forecasting-Using-Timeseries-Data
In this implementstion, we'll work using a timeseries dataset recorded at the Weather Station at the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry in Jena, Germany (http://www.bgc-jena.mpg.de/wetter/).
In this dataset, 14 different quantities (such air temperature, atmospheric pressure, humidity, wind direction, and so on) were recorded every 10 minutes, over several years. The original data goes back to 2003, but this example is limited to data from 2009â€“2016.
Our goal by using this dataset is to feed a machine learning algorithm with air temperature data from the recent past in order to predict the air temperature 24 hours after.
